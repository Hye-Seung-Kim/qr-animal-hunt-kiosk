// model and a procedural one can sit side by side in SPECIES without each
// one needing hand-tuned numbers. `targetSize` is the desired largest
// dimension (X/Y/Z) after scaling -- tune per-model if one still reads as
// too big/small relative to the others.

// Deliberately renders gltf.scene directly instead of cloning it: only one
// species is ever mounted at a time (see AnimalRig), so there's no need for
// a separate instance, and Object3D.clone(true) is well known to break
// SkinnedMesh models -- it doesn't correctly rebind the cloned skeleton's
// bones to the cloned mesh, which silently breaks rendering (this is
// exactly what happened to the rigged/animated cat model).
